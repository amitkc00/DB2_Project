SCHEDULE:
3/5  - Have design/layout done
3/12 - Finish coding
3/19 - Finish testing
3/26 - Try to implement delete



NOTES:

bt_builder is responsible for splitting nodes and promoting leaf nodes to index nodes.

Leaf and index nodes need to correctly return codes when they cannot add keys due to being full. 

With these codes the bt_builder knows when to split and promote nodes.

for index nodes in both searching and inserting count is ignored.
